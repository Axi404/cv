  - title: 'PMT: Progressive Mean Teacher via Exploring Temporal Consistency for Semi-Supervised'

    awarder: ECCV2024 Accept List, First Author

    summary: |
      This project presents a simple yet effective semi-supervised learning framework for medical image segmentation. It constructs two sets of Mean Teacher models to form a co-training framework and **leverages the diversity between the representational capabilities of different networks** at different iterations **to build stable diversity among models**. Subsequently, it utilizes pseudo-label filtering and difference-driven alignment **to introduce robust regularization constraints for training**. The paper **achieves state-of-the-art performance** in the field and validates the method's generalization ability across various datasets.

      During the project, my responsibilities included:
      - Independently proposing research ideas and conceptualizing model implementation.
      - Independently completing experimental work for the paper (including comparative experiments and ablation studies)
      - Worked closely with the supervisor to ensure the quality of paper writing, figure drawing and addressing rebuttals.

    summary: |
      As the leader of the vision team, I organized and led the team to build the visual framework, implement algorithms, deploy, and maintain them. I undertook the main responsibilities in the project. I collaborated with the mechanical and electrical control teams and led the team to win the first prize nationwide for building a robot from scratch.

      During the project, my responsibilities included:
      - Detecting targets using both traditional vision methods and deep learning.
      - Implementing target tracking using filtering algorithms(e.g., EKF).
      - Debugging and developing SLAM programs based on ROS for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance.
      - Development using Linux systems.
